# JSONWebAppDecoder

This is a JSON Token Decoder Web App I made with CHATGPT-3. It works pretty well!

To run locally, run the following commands to install the necessary npm dependencies in your the project's main folder:

1st command:
npm init -y

2nd command:
npm install express body-parser jsonwebtoken

This allows you to decode JWT tokens locally without sending your JWT info to any 3rd parties - Happy testing!
